# Function
# if a group of statments is repeatedly required then it is not recommended ti write these statments every time sepratly. We have to define these statment as a single unit and we can call that unit any numbers of times based on our requierments without rewriting. this uniti is nohing but function.

# The Main Advantage of function is code resuability

#Python support 2 types of function
#1. built in function
#2. User Defined function

# 1. built in functions
# the functions which are coming along with python software automatically, are called built in function or per defined function
#  eg. id(), type(), input(), eval() etc...

# 2. User Defined Functions
# The function which are developed by programmer explicity according to business requirements are colled user defined not functions.

# syntax to create user defined function
# def funtion name(parametes):
#             '''doc string'''
#             return values

# Note While createing functions we can use 2 keywords
# 1. def(mandatory)
# 2. return(optional)

#write a fucntion to print hello
def wish():
    print("Hello Good Morning!!!!")
wish()
wish()
wish()
