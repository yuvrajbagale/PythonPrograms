# Differnaces Between list and Tuple:
# list and tuple are already same except small difference :  list object are mutable where as tuple object are immutable.
#in both case insertion order is preserved, duplicates ojects are allowed, hetrogeneus objects are allowed, index and slicing are supporeded.

# list - list is a comma seprated values within square brackets and Square brackets are mandatory

# Tuple - tuple is a comma separated value within paranethesis and paranethesis are optional

# List object are mutable i.e once we create list object we can perform any chenges in that objecct

# Tuple object are immutable i.e once we create tuple object we cannot changes its content. tuple object does not suppoert item assinement

# list if the content is not fixed and keep on changing then we should go for list.

# Tuple if the content is fixed and never changes then we should go for tuple

#list objects can not be used as keys for dictionary because keys should be hashable and immutable

#Tuple objects can be used as keys for dictionary because key should be hashable and immutable.
